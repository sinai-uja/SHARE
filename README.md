We retrieve this vocabulary using an existing chatbot developed to engage a conversation with users and collect insults via Telegram, named Fiero. This vocabulary has been manually labeled by five annotators obtaining a kappa coefficient agreement of 78.8{\%}. In addition, we leverage the lexicon to release the first corpus in Spanish for offensive span identification research named OffendES{\_}spans. Finally, we show the utility of our resource as an interpretability tool to explain why a comment may be considered offensive.",
